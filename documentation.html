<h1>Movies RESTful API</h1>

<p>
  An API I'm building using node.js, will allow users access information about different movies, directors, and genres.<br>
  Also users will be able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.
</p>

<h2>All features of this API:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow users to see which actors star in which movies</li>
  <li>Allow users to view information about different actors</li>
  <li>Allow users to view more information about different movies,<br>
    such as the release date and the movie rating
  </li>
  <li>Allow users to create a “Watch” list in addition to their “Favorite Movies” list</li>
</ul>
